# Automatic monitoring of room distributions
A voluntary project for the [Sprachschule Aktiv language school](https://www.sprachschule-aktiv-muenchen.de/) helping students to find the rooms in which their courses take place.

By building this simple web-app using Node.js and Express, automatic fetching and displaying of data without any need for manual interaction can be achieved.
